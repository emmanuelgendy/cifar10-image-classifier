The [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes:

- airplane
- automobile
- bird
- cat
- deer
- dog
- frog
- horse
- ship
- truck

## âš™ Model Architecture

We trained a simple CNN using TensorFlow:

- Input: 32x32 color images
- Layers:
  - Conv2D + ReLU + MaxPooling
  - Dropout (to reduce overfitting)
  - Flatten + Dense layers
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

Training was performed using:

```bash
python model_training.py
